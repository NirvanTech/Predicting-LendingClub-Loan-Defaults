# Predicting-LendingClub-Loan-Defaults
With the development of the E business, more and more transactions are made on the internet and also the loaning. The basic topic that we are discussing is lending club, which is one of the most famous and have the largest scale P2P platforms in United States.  Based on the raw data, we processed it by deleting redundant columns and observations.  Combined python with SPSS, we managed to figure out the factors that influenced most on loan status, which has only two results â€“ fully paid or charged off. The innovation of the project is that we utilized the k-fold algorithm in python to optimize the sub grading criteria in order to increase the accuracy. The result of the innovation turned out to be cool, which significantly increased the accuracy and made the chart generated better shaped and closer to the ideal trapezoid.
